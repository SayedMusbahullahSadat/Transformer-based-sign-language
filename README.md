# Transformer-based-sign-language
Developed an AI-powered sign language recognition system using WLASL dataset and MediaPipe 3D hand landmarks. Trained custom Transformer models achieving \~65% accuracy for isolated signs and extended to continuous recognition using CTC loss. Includes real-time GUI, beam-search, mobile optimization.
